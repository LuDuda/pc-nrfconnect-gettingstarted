\n
Follow the [Zephyr SDK with Crosstool NG instructions](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/blob/master/README.md) to build the toolchain for various architectures. You will need to clone the `sdk-ng` repo and run the following command::\n
\n
```\n
./go.sh <arch>\n
```\n
\n
Repeat the step for all architectures you want to support in your environment (Currently only i586 and arm builds are verified).\n

export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=xtools\n
export XTOOLS_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/Volumes/CrossToolNGNew/build/output/\n
```\n
\n
To use the same toolchain in new sessions in the future you can set the variables in the file :file:`${HOME}/.zephyrrc`, for example:\n
\n
```\n
cat <<EOF > ~/.zephyrrc\n
export XTOOLS_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/Volumes/CrossToolNGNew/build/output/\n
export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=xtools\n
EOF\n
