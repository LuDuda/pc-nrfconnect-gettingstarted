sudo apt-get update\
sudo apt-get upgrade\

On Fedora:\
\
```\
sudo dnf upgrade\
```\
\
Note that having a newer version available for an installed package\
(and reported by `dnf check-update`) does not imply a subsequent\
`dnf upgrade` will install it, because it must also ensure dependencies\
and other restrictions are satisfied.\

On Clear Linux:\
\
```\
sudo swupd update\
