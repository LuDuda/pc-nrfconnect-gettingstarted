Additionally, it includes host tools such as custom QEMU binaries\nand a host compiler for building host tools if necessary. The SDK supports the\nfollowing architectures:\n\n* X86 (Intel Architecture 32 bits)\n* X86 IAMCU ABI (Intel Architecture 32 bits IAMCU ABI)\n* ARM (Advanced RISC Machines)\n* ARC (Argonaut RISC Core)\n* Nios II\n* Xtensa\n* RISC-V\n\nFollow these steps to install the SDK on your Linux host system.",
